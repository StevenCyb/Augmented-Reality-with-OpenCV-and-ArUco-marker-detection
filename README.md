# Augmented Reality with OpenCV and ArUco marker detection
This is a simple example of an Augmented Reality cube. The basic description was performed in code.
## How To Use It
I used an Intel Realsense d435 for this project. If you want to use a different camera, you have to change the corresponding code sections.
In order to use the project, you must first calibrate your camera. For this purpose the PDF `ArucoCharucoBoard.pdf` has to be printed. Then start the script `main_calibration.py` and do the calibration. The required actions are output on the console.
As soon as the calibration is finished, the demo `main_ar_demo.py` can be started and viewed.
